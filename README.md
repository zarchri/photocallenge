## Design

### Colour Scheme
* In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file. 
  From the beginning I had a idea about I want it black because I realy like black and white images and want a black and white image in the homepage in the end it ended with black header background wit a green touch in the text.
* I have used `#000000` & '#5C8374' as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.

I have used #ffffff in the input-text in the formsection.
From the befinning I wanted most of a black theme but only chose black and white would be little booring so I decided to change the white color to lightgreen.

I have used #5C8374 for the border-hover effect of the formsection.
