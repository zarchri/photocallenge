## Design

From the befinning I wanted most of a black theme but only chose black and white would be little booring so I decided to change the white color to lightgreen.

In my css file I have used black and lightgreen color

* I have used `#000000` & '#5C8374' as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.

* I have used #5C8374 in the borders in the formsection.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Oswald](@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital@1&family=Oswald:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700&family=Satisfy&display=swap');). I chooce satisfy because I want a font who is easy to read for everyone it is clean and clear.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

  ![favicon](documentation/favicon-image.webp)

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.

In all page you can fint in the footer contact information: adress, phone, email and social media links

#### The Home Page

The home page of Photochallenge displays the sites name as a title and then a container which holds information about the the courses we hold about what they are container, place, time and amount.

![Home page image](docs/readme_images/homepage.png "Home page")



#### The Gallery Page

The gallery page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Here can you see photographs from the different country we have travell to and what photoredigering can do, this page is for little inspirations.

![Image of the gallery page ](docs/readme_images/gallerypage.png "gallery page")



#### The Signup Page

The Signup page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. In this page can you sign you up to our different courses. 
IN the background have I chooce  a image with happy teenager with a camera in a picknic in the nature.

![Signup Page Image](docs/readme_images/group-photo.jpg "signup page")

#### The 404 Error Page

The 404 error page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the page container there is a sorry message explaining to the user that there has been an error directing them to the page they were looking for. The user is then given a choice of three buttons to redirect them to other pages on the site, the home page, the games page and the high scores page.

![Error page image](documentation/features/404.png)

#### The 500 Error Page

The 500 error page displays the sites names as a title, which also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the container is an error message that tells the user sorry there seems to be an issue retrieving the quiz data. Two buttons for the home page and the high scores page are below. I did not add the play game button here, as a user will been directed to this page if there is an error calling the API.

![500 Error Page](documentation/features/500.png)

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Efford onlines courses.
2. add narrator function for the hearing impaired
3. Expand the gallery page with more pictures and different folders with both pictures taken of objects and people on our trips but also pictures of the participants in the courses
4. Style the homepage more there information about the courses are more clear and conspicuous.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site 
-easy for everyone to read.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
