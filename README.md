## CONTENTS

 * Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use on the site.

For the Page Title, I have used the Google font Oswald. I chose this font because I want A font that clearly Shows the title on the page.
For the body of the page, I have used the Google font Lato. Lato is a sans-serif font like the mostly websites use, it is clean and easy to read.

  * [Imagery]
  On the home page I want to use a picture of a person with a camera so the person gets intention. -In the gallery, I have chosen a picture that can interact with the travel goal we will go to in the different photo travels -In the form section, I chose this picture because I want to show the feeling of photographs together and get inspiration from each other.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
* In my CSS file, I have used variable to declare colors and then used these throughout the CSS file. From the beginning, I had an idea that I wanted it black because I like black and white images and want a black and white image on the homepagew. But it would be a little boring with only black and white so I decided to change the white color to light green.

* I have used #000000 & '#5C8374' as the primary and secondary colors used for the site text.
 
* I have used (#3a3a3a) for the border effect on the text input field of the form section.



### Media



The images were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/sok/people%20%20in%20group%20with%20a%20camera/?orientation=landscape "Pexels")

## Credits

### Code Used


I researched in W3school after the code I needed and in the videos in the code institute course and some in chatGPT. I got help from Tutor support and members of the Slack community when I had technical issues.


#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Efford onlines courses.
2. add narrator function for the hearing-impaired.
3. Expand the gallery page with more pictures and different folders with both pictures taken of objects and people on our trips but also pictures of the participants in the courses.
4. Style the homepage more so that there information about the courses is clearer and conspicuous.
