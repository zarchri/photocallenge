## MANUAL TESTING

### Testing User Stories

`First Time Visitors`

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to take part in a pub quiz online and improve my general knowledge. I want to be able to play at any time, anywhere. | The Quiz Arms pulls general knowledge quiz questions from a large variety of topics, much like a pub quiz would do. The site is available for use whenever is convenient to the user. |
| I want the site to be responsive to my device. | I have developed the site with responsiveness in mind. |
| I want the site to be easy to navigate. | Buttons are used throughout the site for navigation, much like a mobile app. As the site is like a mobile app - I decided that I didn't want to add a navigation bar or footer, as these would make the site look more like a traditional webpage. The page title also acts as a link to the home page.  |

`Returning Visitors`

|  Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to be able to choose a level of difficulty that I feel is appropriate for me, based on my experience from my first visit to the site. | Users are able to select their own level of difficulty before the game begins. Once they have played they are free to select a different level of difficulty for subsequent games. |

`Frequent Visitors`

| Goals | How are they achieved? |
| :--- | :--- |
| I want to be able to adjust the difficulty level to keep improving my knowledge. | Users are able to select their own level of difficulty before the game begins. Once they have played they are free to select a different level of difficulty for subsequent games. |
| I want to be able to log my high scores to see how I am performing. | Users of the site are able to log their high scores to the high scores page. The top ten results will be displayed. |

### Full Testing

Full testing was performed on the following devices:

* Laptop:
  * Macbook Pro 2021 14 inch screen
* Mobile Devices:
  * iPhone 13 pro.
  * iPhone 11 pro.
  * Phone X.

Each device tested the site using the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Safari
* Firefox

Additional testing was taken by friends and family on a variety of devices and screen sizes. They reported no issues when playing.

One tester in peer code review stated that the bottom of the play screen was cut off when testing on an iphone SE (2nd gen). I was unable to replicate this issue using google chrome developer tools.
